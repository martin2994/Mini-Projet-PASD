 * \brief Operator \c +: replace the two \c value's on top of the stack by their sum.
 *
 * The \c value's must be integer or float.
 * The result is an integer \c value iff both \c value's are integer.
 * The \c value's are destroyed.
 *
 * If the stack is not deep enough or a wrong kind of \c value is found, then a \c basic_type_error is returned.
 *
 * assert is enforced.
